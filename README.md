🌍 Project Summary
🔎 Objective

The project analyzes global earthquake data from 2001 to 2022 to understand seismic behavior, identify patterns in magnitude, depth, and tsunami occurrence, and determine key factors contributing to tsunami generation.
The study aims to reveal long-term trends, regional clustering, and relationships between earthquake characteristics and tsunami risk.

📊 Methodology

Dataset Used: Global Earthquake–Tsunami dataset (2001–2022)

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

Techniques Applied:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Time-series trend analysis (yearly frequency & magnitude)

Comparative visualizations (box plots, histograms, bar charts)

Geographic distribution plots (Latitude vs Longitude)

Correlation and density analysis (heatmaps, KDE plots)

🌋 Key Findings

Stable Global Trend: Earthquake frequency remained relatively stable over the 22-year period, with no strong upward or downward trend.

Magnitude Pattern: Average magnitudes remained between 6.8–7.1, with occasional spikes during major seismic years (2004, 2011).

Depth Impact: Most earthquakes occurred at shallow to intermediate depths (<300 km), causing stronger surface shaking.

Tsunami Behavior: Tsunami-generating earthquakes were typically larger (≥6.5) and shallower (≤70 km) than non-tsunami events.

Regional Clusters: High tsunami activity was observed in the Pacific Ring of Fire, including Japan, Indonesia, Chile, and Alaska.

Major Events: Catastrophic earthquakes (≥8.0 magnitude) were rare but devastating, notably in 2004 and 2011, both triggering significant tsunamis.

🌊 Insights

Magnitude and Depth Correlation: Large, shallow earthquakes are more likely to cause tsunamis.

Tsunami Threshold Indicators:

Magnitude ≥ 6.5

Depth ≤ 70 km

Coastal or subduction zone location

These parameters serve as early indicators for tsunami risk assessment.
